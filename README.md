# Setting up the Docs Locally

To set up the WasmEdge Docs locally, you will need to follow these general steps:

1. **Clone the project:** Go to the GitHub repository page of the WasmEdge Docs project and click on the "Code" button to get the URL of the repository. Then, open a terminal or command prompt and type the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/WasmEdge/docs.git
```

2. **Install dependencies:** Navigate to the project directory in the terminal and run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Start the development server:** Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server by running the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This should start the development server on port 3000. You can access the running application by opening a web browser and navigating to http://localhost:3000/docs/.

That's it! You should now have a local instance of the WasmEdge Docs running on your machine.
