# Fuzzing

Fuzzing is a dynamic code analysis technique used to discover coding errors and security loopholes in software applications. It involves providing invalid, unexpected, or random data as inputs to a software program. This guide will walk you through the process of setting up and running fuzz tests on WasmEdge applications.

## Prerequisites

- WasmEdge Runtime and API
- C++ Compiler (e.g., GCC or Clang)
- Fuzzing tool (e.g., AFL, libFuzzer)
- Basic knowledge of C++ and WebAssembly
