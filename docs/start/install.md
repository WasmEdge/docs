# Install and uninstall WasmEdge

This chapter will discuss ways to install and uninstall the WasmEdge Runtime on various OSes and platforms. We will cover how to install plug-ins to WasmEdge.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
:::note
Docker Desktop 4.15+ already has WasmEdge bundled in its distribution binary. If you use Docker Desktop, you will not need to install WasmEdge separately. Check out [how to run WasmEdge apps in Docker Desktop.](build-and-run/docker_wasm.md)
:::

## Install

You can install the WasmEdge Runtime on any generic Linux and MacOS platforms. If you use Windows 10 or Fedora / Red Hat Linux systems, you can install with their default package managers.

### Generic Linux and MacOS

The easiest way to install WasmEdge is to run the following command. Your system should have `git` and `curl` as prerequisites.

```bash
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/master/utils/install.sh | bash
```

Run the following command to make the installed binary available in the current session.

```bash
source $HOME/.wasmedge/env
```

#### Install for all users

WasmEdge is installed in the `$HOME/.wasmedge` directory by default. You can install it into a system directory, such as `/usr/local` to make it available to all users. To specify an install directory, run the `install.sh` script with the `-p` flag. You will need to run the following commands as the `root` user or `sudo` since they are written write into system directories.

```bash
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/master/utils/install.sh | bash -s -- -p /usr/local
```

#### Install a specific version of WasmEdge

The WasmEdge installer script will install the latest official release by default. You could install a specific version of WasmEdge, including pre-releases or old releases by passing the `-v` argument to the installer script. Here is an example.

```bash
VERSION={{ wasmedge_version }}
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/master/utils/install.sh | bash -s -- -v $VERSION
```

Suppose you are interested in the latest builds from the `HEAD` of the `master` branch, which is basically WasmEdge's nightly builds. In that case, you can download the release package directly from our Github Action's CI artifact. [Here is an example](https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/actions/runs/2969775464#artifacts).

#### Install WasmEdge with plug-ins

WasmEdge plug-ins are pre-built native modules that provide additional functionalities to the WasmEdge Runtime. To install plug-ins with the runtime, you can pass the `--plugins` parameter in the installer. For example, the command below installs the `wasi_nn-ggml` plug-in to enable LLM (Large Language Model) inference.

```bash
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/master/utils/install.sh | bash -s -- --plugins wasi_nn-ggml
```

To install multiple plug-ins, you can pass a list of plug-ins with the `--plugins` option. For example, the following command installs the `wasi_logging`` and the `wasi_nn-ggml` plug-ins. The `wasi_logging` plug-in allows the Rust [log::Log](https://crates.io/crates/log) API to compile into Wasm and run in WasmEdge.

```bash
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/master/utils/install.sh | bash -s -- --plugins wasi_logging wasi_nn-ggml
```

The installer downloads the plug-in files from the WasmEdge release on GitHub, unzips them, and then copies them over to the `~/.wasmedge/plugin/` folder (for user install) and to the `/usr/local/lib/wasmedge/` folder (for system install).

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
:::note
AI plug-ins for WasmEdge, such as the `OpenVINO backend` or `PyTorch backend` for `WASI-NN` plug-ins, have additional dependencies on the `OpenVINO` or `PyTorch` runtime libraries. [See the next section](#install-wasmedge-plug-ins-and-dependencies) for commands to install the plug-in dependencies.
:::

### Windows

For `Windows 10`, you could use Windows Package Manager Client (aka `winget.exe`) to install WasmEdge with one single command in your terminal.

```bash
winget install wasmedge
```

To install plug-ins, you can download plug-in binary modules from the WasmEdge release page, unzip them, and then copy them to `C:\Program Files\WasmEdge\lib`.

### Fedora and Red Hat Linux

WasmEdge is now an official package on Fedora 36, Fedora 37, Fedora 38, Fedora EPEL 8, and Fedora EPEL 9. Check out the stable version [here](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/wasmedge). To install WasmEdge on Fedora, run the following command:

```bash
dnf install wasmedge
```

For more usages, please check out Fedora docs.

To install plug-ins, you can download plug-in binary modules from the WasmEdge release page, unzip them, and then copy them over to `/usr/local/lib/wasmedge/`.

## What's installed

If you install into the `$HOME/.wasmedge` directory, you will have the following directories and files after installation:

- The `$HOME/.wasmedge/bin` directory contains the WasmEdge Runtime CLI executable files. You can copy and move them around on your file system.

  - The `wasmedge` tool is the standard WasmEdge runtime. You can use it from the CLI.
    - Execute a WASM file: `wasmedge --dir .:. app.wasm`
  - The `wasmedgec` tool is the ahead-of-time (AOT) compiler to compile a `.wasm` file into a native `.so` file (or `.dylib` on MacOS, `.dll` on Windows, or `.wasm` as the universal WASM format on all platforms). The `wasmedge` can then execute the output file.

    - Compile a WASM file into a AOT-compiled WASM: `wasmedgec app.wasm app.so`
    - Execute the WASM in AOT mode: `wasmedge --dir .:. app.so`

    <!-- prettier-ignore -->
    :::note
    The usage of `wasmedgec` is equal to `wasmedge compile`. We decide to deprecate `wasmedgec` in the future.
    :::

- The `$HOME/.wasmedge/lib` directory contains WasmEdge shared libraries and dependency libraries. They are useful for WasmEdge SDKs to launch WasmEdge programs and functions from host applications.
- The `$HOME/.wasmedge/include` directory contains the WasmEdge header files. They are useful for WasmEdge SDKs.
- The `$HOME/.wasmedge/plugin` directory contains the WasmEdge plug-ins. They are loadable extensions for WasmEdge SDKs and will automatically be loaded when running the WasmEdge CLI.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
:::note
You could also change it to `/usr/local` if you did a system-wide install.
If you used `winget` to install WasmEdge, the files are located at `C:\Program Files\WasmEdge`.
:::

## Install WasmEdge plug-ins and dependencies

WasmEdge uses plug-ins to extend its functionality. If you want to use more of WasmEdge's features, you can install WasmEdge along with its plug-ins and extensions as described below:

### The logging plug-in

The `wasi_logging` plug-in supports the [log::Log](https://crates.io/crates/log) Rust API.
It allows [log::Log](https://crates.io/crates/log) in Rust code to be compiled to Wasm and to run in WasmEdge.

```bash
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/master/utils/install.sh | bash -s -- --plugins wasi_logging
```

[See more examples](https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/tree/master/examples/plugin/wasi-logging)

### WASI-NN plug-ins

WasmEdge supports various backends for `WASI-NN`, which provides a standardized API for WasmEdge applications to access AI models for inference. Each backend supports a specific type of AI models.

- [ggml backend](#wasi-nn-plug-in-with-ggml-backend): supported on `Ubuntu 20.04+` and macOS.
- [PyTorch backend](#wasi-nn-plug-in-with-pytorch-backend): supported on `Ubuntu 20.04+` and `manylinux2014_x86_64`.
- [OpenVINOâ„¢ backend](#wasi-nn-plug-in-with-openvino-backend): supported on `Ubuntu 20.04+`.
- [TensorFlow-Lite backend](#wasi-nn-plug-in-with-tensorflow-lite-backend): supported on `Ubuntu 20.04+`, `manylinux2014_x86_64`, and `manylinux2014_aarch64`.

Noticed that the backends are exclusive. Developers can only choose and install one backend for the `WASI-NN` plug-in.

#### WASI-NN plug-in with ggml backend

The WASI-NN plug-in with ggml backend allows WasmEdge to run llama2 inference. To install WasmEdge with WASI-NN ggml backend, please pass the `wasi_nn-ggml` option to the `--plugins` flag when running the installer command.

```bash
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/master/utils/install.sh | bash -s -- --plugins wasi_nn-ggml
```

Please note, the installer from WasmEdge 0.13.5 will detect CUDA automatically. If CUDA is detected, the installer will always attempt to install a CUDA-enabled version of the plug-in.

If CPU is the only available hardware on your machine, the installer will install OpenBLAS version of plugin instead.

```bash
apt update && apt install -y libopenblas-dev # You may need sudo if the user is not root.
```

```bash
export PYTORCH_VERSION="1.8.2"
# For the Ubuntu 20.04 or above, use the libtorch with cxx11 abi.
export PYTORCH_ABI="libtorch-cxx11-abi"
# For the manylinux2014, please use the without cxx11 abi version:
#   export PYTORCH_ABI="libtorch"
curl -s -L -O --remote-name-all https://download.pytorch.org/libtorch/lts/1.8/cpu/${PYTORCH_ABI}-shared-with-deps-${PYTORCH_VERSION}%2Bcpu.zip
unzip -q "${PYTORCH_ABI}-shared-with-deps-${PYTORCH_VERSION}%2Bcpu.zip"
rm -f "${PYTORCH_ABI}-shared-with-deps-${PYTORCH_VERSION}%2Bcpu.zip"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:$(pwd)/libtorch/lib
```

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
:::note
For the `Ubuntu 20.04` or above versions, the WasmEdge installer will install the `Ubuntu` version of WasmEdge and its plug-ins.

```

If the `wasmedge` binary is not in `PATH` and it wasn't installed in the default `$HOME/.wasmedge` folder, then you must provide the installation path.

```bash
bash <(curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/master/utils/uninstall.sh) -p /path/to/parent/folder
```

If you wish to uninstall uninteractively, you can pass in the `--quick` or `-q` flag.

```bash
bash <(curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/master/utils/uninstall.sh) -q
```

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
:::note
If a parent folder of the `wasmedge` binary contains `.wasmedge`, the folder will be considered for removal. For example, the script altogether removes the default `$HOME/.wasmedge` folder.
:::

If you used `dnf` to install WasmEdge on Fedora and Red Hat Linux, run the following command to uninstall it:

```bash
dnf remove wasmedge
```

If you used `winget` to install WasmEdge on Windows, run the following command to uninstall it:

```bash
winget uninstall wasmedge
```
