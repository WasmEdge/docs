# Guide for Contributing to WasmEdge

Contribution is always welcome! The WebAssembly ecosystem is still in its early days. Hosted by CNCF, WasmEdge aims to become an open source “reference implementation” of WebAssembly and its edge-related extensions. WasmEdge is developed in the open, and is constantly being improved by our users, contributors, and maintainers. It is because of you that we can bring great software to the community.We're looking forward to working together with you!

To help new contributors understand WasmEdge development workflow, this guide will include

* [Build WasmEdge and WasmEdge plug-in from source on different platforms](/docs/category/build-wasmedge-from-source)
* [WasmEdge Plug-in system introduction](/docs/category/wasmedge-plugin-system)
* [Test WasmEdge](test.md)
* [WasmEdge Fuzzing](fuzzing.md)
* [WasmEdge internal explanation](internal.md)
* [WasmEdge installer system explanation](installer.md)
* [contributing steps](contribute.md)
* [WasmEdge release process](release.md)
* [Join WasmEdge community](community.md)

## Ideas for contributions

If you're looking for something to contribute, we have 

* labeled with [`good first issue` issues](https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22), which are recommendations for developers to contribute to WasmEdge by some easy tasks. Those tasks will help contributors to learn the WasmEdge development workflow.

* labeled with [`help wanted` issues](https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22), which are that we need suggestions and opinions from the community.

* [Roadmap](https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/blob/master/docs/ROADMAP.md) for every year, which elaborates the new features in the coming days. You're also welcome to pick one.


If you find something is missing, don't hesitate to create an issue and let us know. Again, WasmEdge is open in development.


## Mentoring

WasmEdge maintainers can provide mentoring for WasmEdge, WebAssembly, C++, Rust, compiler etc. If you're interest in fixing  one open issue, just let us know by commenting under the issue. WasmEdge maintainers will reply to your question in time.

Besides the regular GitHub issues, the WasmEdge project will participate in some open source mentoring projects like Google Summer of Code (GSoC), LFX mentorship, and Open Source Promotion Plan (OSPP).
