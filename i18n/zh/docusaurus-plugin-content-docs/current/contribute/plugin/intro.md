# 3.1 WasmEdge Plug-in System Introduction

While the WasmEdge language SDKs allow registering host functions from a host (wrapping) application, developers should implement the host functions before compilation.

For the other solutions, WasmEdge provides the plug-in architecture to load the plug-in shared library for easier extending of the host functions.

With developing the plug-ins, WasmEdge SDKs in the supported languages can load and register the host functions from the plug-in shared libraries.

In current, developers can follow the guides to implement the plug-ins in [C API (recommended)](develop_plugin_c.md) or [C++](develop_plugin_cpp.md).

## Loadable Plug-in

Loadable plugin is a standalone `.so`/`.dylib`/`.dll` file that WasmEdge can load during runtime environment, and provide modules to be imported.

Please [refer to the plugin example code](https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/tree/master/examples/plugin/get-string).

## WasmEdge Currently Released Plug-ins

There are several plug-in releases with the WasmEdge official releases.
Please check the following table to check the release status and how to build from source with the plug-ins.

> The `WasmEdge-Process` plug-in is attached in the WasmEdge release tarballs.

> Due to the `OpenVINO` and `PyTorch` dependencies, we only release the WASI-NN plug-in on `Ubuntu 20.04 x86_64` now. We'll work with `manylinux2014` versions in the future.
