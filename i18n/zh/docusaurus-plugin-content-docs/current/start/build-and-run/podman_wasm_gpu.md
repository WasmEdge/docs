# Podman + WASM + GPU

Podman + Crun with Wasmedge + [CDI](https://github.com/cncf-tags/container-device-interface) to enable the usage of host GPU devices. Most of the steps are the same with [docker + wasm + gpu](./docker_wasm_gpu.md), except for the installation of Podman and execution command. If the following steps have already been executed before, you could just skip them.

## Prerequisite

Before we start, you need

- GPU device (Here we will take NVIDIA graphics cards as our example and we have only conducted tests on NVIDIA GPUs on linux for now)
  - Install NVIDIA GPU Driver
  - Install either the NVIDIA Container Toolkit or you installed the nvidia-container-toolkit-base package.
- Podman >= 4.x

Regarding the installation of the NVIDIA driver and toolkit, we won't go into detail here, but we could provide a few reference documents and the ways to verify your environment is ok.

[Nvidia drivers installation on ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/nvidia-drivers-installation), [Toolkit install guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html), [Nvidia CDI supoort reference](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/cdi-support.html)

```bash
# check your driver and device
> nvidia-smi -L

# Check your toolkit
> nvidia-ctk --version
```

Install podman >= 4.0

The current testing phase involves directly installing Podman from Linuxbrew to meet version requirements. There may be more elegant methods in the future, and we will update the documentation accordingly.

```bash
> brew install podman

# Check your podman version and you could add it to your $PATH, too.
> $HOME/.linuxbrew/opt/podman/bin/podman --version
```

## CDI setup

[Generate the CDI specification file](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/cdi-support.html#procedure)

```bash
> sudo nvidia-ctk cdi generate --output=/etc/cdi/nvidia.yaml

# Check you cdi config is good
> nvidia-ctk cdi list

# Example output
INFO[0000] Found 2 CDI devices
nvidia.com/gpu=0
nvidia.com/gpu=all
```

## Setup your container runtime (crun + wasmedge + plugin system)

Build crun with wasmedge enable

```bash
> sudo apt install -y make git gcc build-essential pkgconf libtool libsystemd-dev libprotobuf-c-dev libcap-dev libseccomp-dev libyajl-dev go-md2man libtool autoconf python3 automake

> git clone https://github.com/containers/crun
> cd crun
> ./autogen.sh
> ./configure --with-wasmedge
> make

# Check your crun
> ./crun --version
```

Download ggml plugin into host

```bash
> curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/master/utils/install.sh | bash -s -- --plugins wasi_nn-ggml

# Make sure all your plugin dependencies is good
> ldd ~/.wasmedge/plugin/libwasmedgePluginWasiNN.so
```

## Demo llama with our wasm application

> The demo image is built the Wasm application from [here](https://github.com/second-state/WasmEdge-WASINN-examples/tree/master/wasmedge-ggml/llama), and upload it to [here](https://github.com/captainvincent/runwasi/pkgs/container/runwasi-demo/195178675?tag=wasmedge-ggml-llama).

Download inference model

```bash
> curl -LO https://huggingface.co/second-state/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGUF/resolve/main/llama-2-7b-chat.Q5_K_M.gguf
```

Podman run llama2 inference

> You need to replace the  `<podman path>` and `<crun path>` with your binary path in the following command.

```bash
sudo <podman path> run -v ~/.wasmedge/plugin/libwasmedgePluginWasiNN.so:/.wasmedge/plugin/libwasmedgePluginWasiNN.so \
  -v /usr/local/cuda/targets/x86_64-linux/lib/libcudart.so.12:/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcudart.so.12 \
  -v /usr/local/cuda/targets/x86_64-linux/lib/libcublas.so.12:/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcublas.so.12 \
  -v /usr/local/cuda/targets/x86_64-linux/lib/libcublasLt.so.12:/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcublasLt.so.12 \
  -v /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcuda.so.1:/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcuda.so.1 \
  -v .:/resource \
  --env WASMEDGE_PLUGIN_PATH=/.wasmedge/plugin \
  --env WASMEDGE_WASINN_PRELOAD=default:GGML:AUTO:/resource/llama-2-7b-chat.Q5_K_M.gguf \
  --env n_gpu_layers=100 \
  --rm --device nvidia.com/gpu=all --runtime <crun path> --annotation module.wasm.image/variant=compat-smart --platform wasip1/wasm \
