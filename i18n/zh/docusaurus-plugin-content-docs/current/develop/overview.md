# Develop WASM Apps

A fundamental value proposition of WebAssembly is that it supports multiple programming languages. WebAssembly is a "managed runtime" for many programming languages including [C/C++](/category/develop-wasm-apps-in-cc), [Rust](/category/develop-wasm-apps-in-rust), [Go](/category/develop-wasm-apps-in-go), and even [JavaScript](/category/develop-wasm-apps-in-javascript) and [Python](/category/develop-wasm-apps-in-python).

- For compiled languages (e.g., C and Rust), WasmEdge WebAssembly provides a safe, secure, isolated, and containerized runtime as opposed to Native Client (NaCl).
- For interpreted or managed languages (e.g., JavaScript and Python), WasmEdge WebAssembly provides a secure, fast, lightweight, and containerized runtime instead of Docker + guest OS + native interpreter.

This chapter will discuss how to compile sources into WebAssembly in different languages and run them in WasmEdge.

- Develop WebAssembly apps from your programming languages from [Rust](/category/develop-wasm-apps-in-rust), [C/C++](/category/develop-wasm-apps-in-cc), [JavaScript](/category/develop-wasm-apps-in-javascript), [Go](/category/develop-wasm-apps-in-go), and many other languages.
- [Deploy WASM Apps with the existing container toolings](/category/deploy-wasmedge-apps-in-kubernetes)

Besides this, we also have two more guides for [Embedding WASM Functions](../embed/overview.md) and [Contributing](../contribute/overview.md) to WasmEdge.
