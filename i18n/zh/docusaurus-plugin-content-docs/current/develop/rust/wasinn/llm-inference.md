# Llama 2 inference

WasmEdge now supports running llama2 series of models in Rust. We will use [this example project](https://github.com/second-state/llama-utils/tree/main/chat) to show how to make AI inferences with the llama2 model in WasmEdge and Rust.

WasmEdge now supports Llama2, Codellama-instruct, BELLE-Llama, Mistral-7b-instruct, Wizard-vicuna, and raguile-chatml. 

## Prerequisite

Besides the [regular WasmEdge and Rust requirements](../../rust/setup.md), please make sure that you have the [Wasi-NN plugin with ggml installed](../../../start/install.md#wasi-nn-plug-in-with-ggml-backend).

## Quick start
Because the example already includes a compiled WASM file from the Rust code, we could use WasmEdge CLI to execute the example directly. First, git clone the `llama-utils` repo.

```
git clone https://github.com/second-state/llama-utils.git
cd chat
```

Next, let's get the model. In this example, we are going to use the llama2 7b chat model in GGUF format. You can also use other kinds of llama2 models, check out [here](https://github.com/second-state/llama-utils/blob/main/chat/README.md#get-model).

```
git clone curl -LO https://huggingface.co/wasmedge/llama2/blob/main/llama-2-7b-chat-q5_k_m.gguf
```

Run the inference application in WasmEdge.

```
wasmedge --dir .:. \
  --nn-preload default:GGML:CPU:llama-2-7b-chat-q5_k_m.gguf \
  llama-chat.wasm --model-alias default --prompt-template llama-2-chat
```
After executing the command, you may need to wait a moment for the input prompt to appear. You can enter your question once you see the `[USER]:` prompt:

```
[USER]:
What's the capital of France?
[ASSISTANT]:
The capital of France is Paris.
[USER]:
what about Norway?
[ASSISTANT]:
The capital of Norway is Oslo.
[USER]:
I have two apples, each costing 5 dollars. What is the total cost of these apples?
[ASSISTANT]:
The total cost of the two apples is 10 dollars.
[USER]:
What if I have 3 apples?
[ASSISTANT]:
If you have 3 apples, each costing 5 dollars, the total cost of the apples is 15 dollars.
```

## Build and run
Let's build the wasm file from the rust source code. First, git clone the `llama-utils` repo.

```
git clone https://github.com/second-state/llama-utils.git
cd chat
```
Second, use `cargo` to build the example project.

```
cargo build --target wasm32-wasi --release
```

The output WASM file is `target/wasm32-wasi/release/llama-chat.wasm`. 

We also need to get the model. Here we use the llama-2-13b model.

```
curl -LO https://huggingface.co/wasmedge/llama2/blob/main/llama-2-13b-q5_k_m.gguf
```
Next, use WasmEdge to load the llama-2-13b model and then ask the model to questions by input your .

```
wasmedge --dir .:. \
  --nn-preload default:GGML:CPU:llama-2-13b-q5_k_m.gguf \
  llama-chat.wasm --model-alias default --prompt-template llama-2-chat
```
After executing the command, you may need to wait a moment for the input prompt to appear. You can enter your question once you see the `[USER]:` prompt:

```
[USER]:
Who is the "father of the atomic bomb"?
[ASSISTANT]:
The "father of the atomic bomb" is a term commonly associated with physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer was a leading figure in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II, serving as the director of the Manhattan Project, which was responsible for the development and deployment of the first nuclear weapons. He is often referred to as the "father of the atomic bomb" due to his significant contributions to the field of nuclear physics and his leadership in the development of the bomb.
```

## Optional: Configure the model

You can use environment variables to configure the model execution.

| Option	|Default	|Function |
| -------|-----------|----- |
| LLAMA_LOG|	0	|The backend will print diagnostic information when this value is set to 1|
|LLAMA_N_CTX	|512|	The context length is the max number of tokens in the entire conversation|
|LLAMA_N_PREDICT |512|The number of tokens to generate in each response from the model|

For example, the following command specifies a context length of 4k tokens, which is standard for llama2, and the max number of tokens in each response to be 1k. It also tells WasmEdge to print out logs and statistics of the model at runtime.

```
LLAMA_LOG=1 LLAMA_N_CTX=4096 LLAMA_N_PREDICT=1024 wasmedge --dir .:. \
    --nn-preload default:GGML:CPU:lllama-2-7b-chat-q5_k_m.gguf \
    llama-chat.wasm default

llama_print_timings:        eval time =  3710.33 ms /   103 runs   (   36.02 ms per token,    27.76 tokens per second)
Answer:
The "father of the atomic bomb" is a term commonly associated with physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer was a leading figure in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II, serving as the director of the Manhattan Project, which was responsible for the development and deployment of the first nuclear weapons. He is often referred to as the "father of the atomic bomb" due to his significant contributions to the field of nuclear physics and his leadership in the development of the bomb.

## Improve performance

You can make the inference program run faster by AOT compiling the wasm file first.

```
wasmedge compile llama-chat.wasm llama-chat.wasm
wasmedge --dir .:. \
  --nn-preload default:GGML:CPU:llama-2-13b-q5_k_m.gguf \
  llama-chat.wasm --model-alias default --prompt-template llama-2-chat
```

## Understand the code

The [main.rs](https://github.com/second-state/llama-utils/blob/main/chat/src/main.rs
) is the full Rust code to create an interactive chatbot using a LLM. The Rust program manages the user input, tracks the conversation history, transforms the text into the llama2 and other modelâ€™s chat templates, and runs the inference operations using the WASI NN standard API.

First, let's parse command line arguments to customize the chatbot's behavior using `Command` struct. It extracts the following parameters: `prompt` (a prompt that guides the conversation), `model_alias` (a list for the loaded model), and `ctx_size` (the size of the chat context). 

```
fn main() -> Result<(), String> {
    let matches = Command::new("Llama API Server")
        .arg(
            Arg::new("prompt")
                .short('p')
                .long("prompt")
                .value_name("PROMPT")
                .help("Sets the prompt.")
                .required(true),
        )
        .arg(
            Arg::new("model_alias")
                .short('m')
                .long("model-alias")
                .value_name("ALIAS")
                .help("Sets the model alias")
                .default_value("default"),
        )
        .arg(
            Arg::new("ctx_size")
                .short('c')
                .long("ctx-size")
                .value_parser(clap::value_parser!(u32))
                .value_name("CTX_SIZE")
                .help("Sets the prompt context size")
                .default_value(DEFAULT_CTX_SIZE),
        )
        .get_matches();

    // model alias
    let model_name = matches
        .get_one::<String>("model_alias")
        .unwrap()
        .to_string();

    // prompt context size
    let ctx_size = matches.get_one::<u32>("ctx_size").unwrap();
    CTX_SIZE
        .set(*ctx_size as usize)
        .expect("Fail to parse prompt context size");

    // prompt
    let prompt = matches.get_one::<String>("prompt").unwrap().to_string();
```

After that, the program will create a new Graph using the `GraphBuilder` and loads the model specified by the `model_name` .

```
// load the model to wasi-nn
     let graph =
        wasi_nn::GraphBuilder::new(wasi_nn::GraphEncoding::Ggml, wasi_nn::ExecutionTarget::AUTO)
            .build_from_cache(&model_name)
            .expect("Failed to load the model");
```

Next, We create an execution context from the loaded Graph. The context is mutable because we will be changing it when we set the input tensor and execute the inference.

```
 // initialize the execution context
    let mut context = graph
        .init_execution_context()
        .expect("Failed to init context");
```
Next, The prompt is converted into bytes and set as the input tensor for the model inference.

```
 // set input tensor
    let tensor_data = prompt.as_str().as_bytes().to_vec();
    context
        .set_input(0, wasi_nn::TensorType::U8, &[1], &tensor_data)
        .expect("Failed to set prompt as the input tensor");
```

Next, excute the model inference.

```
  // execute the inference
    context.compute().expect("Failed to complete inference");
```

After the inference is fiished, extract the result from the computation context and losing invalid UTF8 sequences handled by converting the output to a string using `String::from_utf8_lossy`.

```
  let mut output_buffer = vec![0u8; *CTX_SIZE.get().unwrap()];
    let mut output_size = context
        .get_output(0, &mut output_buffer)
        .expect("Failed to get output tensor");
    output_size = std::cmp::min(*CTX_SIZE.get().unwrap(), output_size);
    let output = String::from_utf8_lossy(&output_buffer[..output_size]).to_string();
```

Finally, print the prompt and the inference output to the console.

```
println!("\nprompt: {}", &prompt);
println!("\noutput: {}", output);
```
