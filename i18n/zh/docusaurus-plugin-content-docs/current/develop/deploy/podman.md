# 8.3 Podman

## Fedora Platform

The easiest platform to run Wasm app with container is Fedora, because the crun fedora package has supported WasmEdge as a default runtime. We don't need to make any changes to run WasmEdge apps on fedora platform. If you use other Linux distributions, go to [next section](#other-linux-distributions).

### Install podman and WasmEdge


```bash
sudo dnf -y install podman
sudo dnf -y install wasmedge
```
### Run A simple WASI app

Now, we could run wasm apps.

```bash
 podman run --rm --annotation module.wasm.image/variant=compat-smart docker.io/wasmedge/example-wasi:latest /wasi_example_main.wasm 50000000
```

That's it.


## Other Linux distributions

### Prerequisites

1. Install and configure Podman 

Use the following commands to install podman on your system. Here I use Ubuntu as an example. For more different types of podman, please refer to [Podman's installation instruction](https://podman.io/getting-started/installation).

```bash
sudo apt-get -y update
sudo apt-get -y install podman
```
2. [Install WasmEdge](../build-and-run/install)

3. Build and configure crun with WasmEdge support

Next, configure and build a `crun` binary with WasmEdge support.

```bash
./autogen.sh
./configure --with-wasmedge
make
sudo make install
# replace crun (be careful, you may want to do a bakup first)
mv crun $(which crun)
```

Then, you can use `crun -v` to check out if crun is installed successfully.

```bash
crun --version
# Output
crun version 1.7.2.0.0.0.26-51af

```

### Run A simple WASI app

 Now, we could run wasm apps.

```bash
 podman run --rm --annotation module.wasm.image/variant=compat-smart docker.io/wasmedge/example-wasi:latest /wasi_example_main.wasm 50000000
```

For more information, you could refered to [crun](../deploy/oci-runtime/crun) chapter.

There is a great open source project introducing podman and Wasm from community called [Kwasm](https://github.com/KWasm/podman-wasm). Check it out!
