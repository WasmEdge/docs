# 8.5.3 Deploy with youki

youki is an OCI container runtime written in Rust. youki has WasmEdge baked in. This chapter will walk you through deploying Wasm images with youki.

## Prerequisites

1. Build and configure youki with WasmEdge support

We will use ubuntu 20.04 as an example. For other OS, please [see here](https://containers.github.io/youki/user/basic_setup.html).

Run the following command line to build and install youki on your machine

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install   \
      pkg-config         \
      libsystemd-dev     \
      libdbus-glib-1-dev \
      build-essential    \
      libelf-dev \
      libseccomp-dev \
      libclang-dev
```
Next, configure, build, and install a `youki` binary with WasmEdge support.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/containers/youki.git
go into the cloned directory
cd youki
make youki-dev 
./youki -h 
./scripts/build.sh -o . -r -f wasm-wasmedge
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/.wasmedge/lib
```

2. [Install WasmEdge](../../build-and-run/install)

3. Configure the `config.json` from youki to run Wasm modules.

To run a webassembly module with youki, the `config.json` has to include either runc.oci.handler or module.wasm.image/variant=compat". It also needs you to specify a valid .wasm (webassembly binary) or .wat (webassembly test) module as entrypoint for the container.

```json
"ociVersion": "1.0.2-dev",
"annotations": {
    "run.oci.handler": "wasm"
},
"process": {
    "args": [
        "wasi_example_main.wasm",
        ],
```


## Run a simple WebAssembly app

Now we can run a simple WebAssembly app. [A separate article](https://github.com/second-state/wasmedge-containers-examples/blob/main/simple_wasi_app.md) explains how to compile, package, and publish the WebAssembly program as a container image to Docker hub.

```bash
sudo ctr i pull docker.io/wasmedge/example-wasi:latest
```

Run the example with Youki and Podman.

```bash
sudo podman --runtime /PATH/WHARE/YOU/BUILT/WITH/WASM-WASMEDGE/youki run /wasi_example_main.wasm 50000000
```

That's it.
