# Quick start on Linux

In this guide, we will walk you through how to quickly install and run the WasmEdge Runtime on a generic Linux distribution (such as Ubuntu, Debian, Raspberry OS or WSL on Windows). Comprehensive and OS-specific installation instructions can be found [here](../build-and-run/install).

:::note 
If you have Docker Desktop 4.15 and above, you can skip this and [get started here](quick_start_docker). For Fedora Linux / Red Hat Linux / OpenShift / Podman users, [get started here](quick_start_redhat).
:::

We will cover the following examples:

* [How to run a standalone Wasm app](#run-a-standalone-wasm-app)
* [How to run an HTTP server](#run-an-http-server)
* [How to run a JavaScript server (node.js)](#run-a-javascript-based-server)


## One-liner Installation of WasmEdge

The easiest way to install WasmEdge is to run the following command. You should have root or at least `sudo` privilege. Your system should have `git` and `curl` installed as prerequisites.

```bash
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/master/utils/install.sh | sudo bash -s -- -p /usr/local
```

> If you do not have root or `sudo` rights, use the following line to install WasmEdge in your `$HOME/.wasmedge` directory:

```bash
 `curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/master/utils/install.sh | bash`
```


## How to run a standalone Wasm app

The Hello world example is a standalone Rust application that can be executed by the [WasmEdge CLI](../build-and-run/cli). Its source code and build instructions are available [here](https://github.com/second-state/rust-examples/tree/main/hello).

Download the hello.wasm file [here](/files/hello.wasm), or run the following command:

```bash
wget https://wasmedge.org/books/app-dev-guide/en/files/hello.wasm
```

Use the `wasmedge` command to run the program.

```bash
$ wasmedge hello.wasm
Hello WasmEdge!
```

Use the AoT compiler `wasmedgec` to get much better performance.

```bash
$ wasmedgec hello.wasm hello_aot.wasm
$ wasmedge hello_aot.wasm
Hello WasmEdge!
```

## How to run an HTTP server

This example is a standalone HTTP server written in Rust. It demonstrates that Rust + WasmEdge as a lightweight stack for microservices. Its source code and build instructions are available [here](https://github.com/second-state/rust-examples/tree/main/server).

Download the server.wasm file [here](/files/server.wasm), or run the following command:

```bash
wget https://wasmedge.org/books/app-dev-guide/en/files/server.wasm
```

Use the `wasmedge` command to run the program.

```bash
$ wasmedge server.wasm
Listening on http://0.0.0.0:8080
```

From another terminal window, do the following.

```bash
$ curl http://localhost:8080/
Try POSTing data to /echo such as: `curl localhost:8080/echo -XPOST -d 'hello world'`

$ curl http://localhost:8080/echo -X POST -d "Hello WasmEdge"
Hello WasmEdge
```

## How to run a JavaScript-based server

This example is a standalone HTTP server written in JavaScript using the node.js API. It demonstrates WasmEdge as a lightweight runtime for node.js applications.
Its source code is available [here](https://github.com/second-state/wasmedge-quickjs/tree/main/example_js/docker_wasm/server).

* Download the wasmedge_quickjs.wasm file [here](https://github.com/second-state/wasmedge-quickjs/releases/download/v0.5.0-alpha/wasmedge_quickjs.wasm), or run the following command:

```bash
wget https://github.com/second-state/wasmedge-quickjs/releases/download/v0.5.0-alpha/wasmedge_quickjs.wasm
```

* Download the modules.zip file [here](https://github.com/second-state/wasmedge-quickjs/releases/download/v0.5.0-alpha/modules.zip), or run the following command:

```bash
wget https://github.com/second-state/wasmedge-quickjs/releases/download/v0.5.0-alpha/modules.zip
```

Unzip the modules.zip file into the current folder as `./modules/`.

```bash
unzip modules.zip
```

* Download the server.js file [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/second-state/wasmedge-quickjs/main/example_js/docker_wasm/server/server.js).

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/second-state/wasmedge-quickjs/main/example_js/docker_wasm/server/server.js
```

Use the `wasmedge` command to run the program.

```bash
$ wasmedge --dir .:. wasmedge_quickjs.wasm server.js
listen 8080 ...
```

From another terminal window, do the following.

```bash
$ curl http://localhost:8080/echo -X POST -d "Hello WasmEdge"
Hello WasmEdge
```
