# The `wasmedge` CLI

After intalling WasmEdge, you can use the `wasmedge` CLI to execute a compiled wasm file. We will cover how to run Wasm files with WasmEdge on your own machine and Docker images.

The `wasmedge` binary is a command line interface (CLI) program that runs WebAssembly programs.

* If the WebAssembly program contains a `main()` function, `wasmedge` would execute it as a standalone program in the command mode.
* If the WebAssembly program contains one or more exported public functions, `wasmedge` could invoke individual functions in the reactor mode.

By default, the `wasmedge` will execute WebAssembly programs in interpreter mode, and [execute the AOT-compiled `.so`, `.dylib`, `.dll`, or `.wasm` (universal output format) in AOT mode](aot.md). If you want to accelerate the WASM execution, we recommend to [compile the WebAssembly with the AOT compiler](aot.md) first.


```bash
$ wasmedge -v
wasmedge version {{ wasmedge_version }}
```

Users can run the `wasmedge -h` for realizing the command line options quickly, or [refer to the detailed `wasmedge` CLI options here](#options).The usage of the `wasmedge` tool will be:

```bash
$ wasmedge -h
USAGE
   wasmedge [OPTIONS] [--] WASM_OR_SO [ARG ...]

...
```

If users install the WasmEdge from the install script with the option `-e tf,image`, the WasmEdge CLI tools with TensorFlow and TensorFlow-Lite extensions will be installed.

* `wasmedge-tensorflow` CLI tool
  * The `wasmedge` tool with TensorFlow, TensorFlow-Lite, and `wasmedge-image` extensions.
  * Only on `x86_64` and `aarch64` Linux platforms and `x86_64` MacOS.
* `wasmedge-tensorflow-lite` CLI tool
  * The `wasmedge` tool with TensorFlow-Lite, and `wasmedge-image` extensions.
  * Only on `x86_64` and `aarch64` Linux platforms, Android, and `x86_64` MacOS.

The `wasmedge` CLI tool will execute the WebAssembly in ahead-of-time(AOT) mode and interpreter mode. It depends on if you use `wasmedgec` to AoT compile the wasm file.

## Examples

### Build and run a standalone WebAssembly app

The Hello world example is a standalone Rust application that can be executed by the [WasmEdge CLI](../build-and-run/cli). Its source code and build instructions are available [here](https://github.com/second-state/rust-examples/tree/main/hello).

You will need to have the [Rust compiler installed](https://github.com/second-state/rust-examples/blob/main/README.md#prerequisites), and then use the following command to build the Wasm bytecode file from the Rust source code.

```bash
cargo build --target wasm32-wasi --release
```

You can then use the `wasmedge` command to run the program.

```bash
$ wasmedge target/wasm32-wasi/release/hello.wasm
Hello WasmEdge!
```

#### Execute with `statistics` enabled

The CLI supports `--enable-all-statistics` flags for the statistics and gas metering.

You can run:

```bash
wasmedge --enable-all-statistics hello.wasm
```

The output will be:

```bash
Hello WasmEdge!
[2021-12-09 16:03:33.261] [info] ====================  Statistics  ====================
[2021-12-09 16:03:33.261] [info]  Total execution time: 268266 ns

[2021-12-09 16:03:33.261] [info] =======================   End   ======================
```

#### Execute with `gas-limit` enabled

The CLI supports `--gas-limit` flags for controlling the execution costs.

For giving sufficient gas as the example, you can run:

```bash
wasmedge --enable-all-statistics --gas-limit 20425 hello.wasm
```

The output will be:

```bash
Hello WasmEdge!
[2021-12-09 16:03:33.261] [info] ====================  Statistics  ====================
[2021-12-09 16:03:33.261] [info]  Total execution time: 268266 ns
[2021-12-09 16:03:33.261] [info]  Wasm instructions execution time: 251610 ns
[2021-12-09 16:03:33.261] [info]  Host functions execution time: 16656 ns
[2021-12-09 16:03:33.261] [info]  Executed wasm instructions count: 20425
[2021-12-09 16:03:33.261] [info]  Gas costs: 20425
[2021-12-09 16:03:33.261] [info]  Instructions per second: 81177218
[2021-12-09 16:03:33.261] [info] =======================   End   ======================
```

For giving insufficient gas as the example, you can run:

```bash
wasmedge --enable-all-statistics --gas-limit 20 hello.wasm
```

The output will be:

```bash
Hello WasmEdge!
[2021-12-23 15:19:06.690] [error] Cost exceeded limit. Force terminate the execution.

```

### Call a WebAssembly function compiled from Rust

The [add](https://github.com/second-state/wasm-learning/tree/master/cli/add) program is written in Rust and contains an exported `add()` function. You can compile it into WebAssembly and use `wasmedge` to call the `add()` function. In this example, you will see how it is done from the CLI. It is often used when you embed WasmEdge into another host application, and need to call a Wasm function from the host.

You will need to have the [Rust compiler installed](https://github.com/second-state/rust-examples/blob/main/README.md#prerequisites), and then use the following command to build the Wasm bytecode file from the Rust source code.

```bash
cargo build --target wasm32-wasi --release
```

You can execute `wasmedge` in reactor mode to invoke the `add()` function with two `i32` integer input parameters.

```bash
wasmedge --reactor add.wasm add 2 2
```

The output will be:

```bash
4
```

### Call a WebAssembly function written in WAT

We created the hand-written [fibonacci.wat](https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/raw/master/examples/wasm/fibonacci.wat) and used the [wat2wasm](https://webassembly.github.io/wabt/demo/wat2wasm/) tool to convert it into the [fibonacci.wasm](https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/raw/master/examples/wasm/fibonacci.wasm) WebAssembly program.
It exported a `fib()` function which takes a single `i32` integer as the input parameter. We can execute `wasmedge` in reactor mode to invoke the exported function.

You can run:

```bash
wasmedge --reactor fibonacci.wasm fib 10
```

The output will be:

```bash
89
```

### JavaScript examples

It is possible to use WasmEdge as a high-performance, secure, extensible, easy to deploy, and [Kubernetes-compliant](https://github.com/second-state/wasmedge-containers-examples) JavaScript runtime.
There is no need to build a JavaScript app. You just need to download the WasmEdge JavaScript runtime for Node.js.

* [Download the wasmedge_quickjs.wasm file here](https://github.com/second-state/wasmedge-quickjs/releases/download/v0.5.0-alpha/wasmedge_quickjs.wasm)
* [Download the modules.zip file here](https://github.com/second-state/wasmedge-quickjs/releases/download/v0.5.0-alpha/modules.zip) and then unzip it into the current folder as `./modules/`

```bash
wget https://github.com/second-state/wasmedge-quickjs/releases/download/v0.5.0-alpha/wasmedge_quickjs.wasm
wget https://github.com/second-state/wasmedge-quickjs/releases/download/v0.5.0-alpha/modules.zip
unzip modules.zip
```

The [hello.js](https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/raw/master/examples/js/hello.js) file is a very simple JavaScript program. You can run:

```bash
wasmedge --dir .:. wasmedge_quickjs.wasm hello.js 1 2 3
```

The output will be:

```bash
Hello 1 2 3
```

The [qjs_tf.wasm](https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/raw/master/examples/wasm/js/qjs_tf.wasm) is a JavaScript interpreter with [WasmEdge Tensorflow extension](https://www.secondstate.io/articles/wasi-tensorflow/) compiled into WebAssembly.
To run [qjs_tf.wasm](https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/raw/master/examples/wasm/js/qjs_tf.wasm), you must use the `wasmedge-tensorflow-lite` CLI tool, which is a build of WasmEdge with Tensorflow-Lite extension built-in.
You can download a full [Tensorflow-based JavaScript example](https://github.com/second-state/wasmedge-quickjs/tree/main/example_js/tensorflow_lite_demo) to classify images.

```bash
# Download the Tensorflow example
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/second-state/wasmedge-quickjs/main/example_js/tensorflow_lite_demo/aiy_food_V1_labelmap.txt
